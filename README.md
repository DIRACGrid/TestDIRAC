# TestDIRAC

This repository is used for collecting tests for DIRAC. Specifically, tests collected here are:

- integration
- regression
- system 

tests

There are also (few) performance tests, and what's important is that in here we collect scripts for automating running these tests, i.e. through Jenkins
